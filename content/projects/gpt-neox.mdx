[GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) is an implementation of 3D-parallel GPT-3-like models on distributed GPUs, based upon [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) and [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM).

Progress:

- As of 31st March, 2021, the codebase is fairly stable. DeepSpeed, 3D-parallelism and ZeRO are all working properly.

Next Steps:

- We are currently waiting for CoreWeave to finish building the final hardware we'll be training on. In the meantime, we are optimizing GPT-NeoX to run as efficiently as possible on that hardware.
